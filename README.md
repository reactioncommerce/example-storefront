# Reaction Storefront Next.js Starter Kit
[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Freactioncommerce%2Freaction-next-starterkit.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Freactioncommerce%2Freaction-next-starterkit?ref=badge_shield)


_**Note:** This project is a work in progress and should not be used in production at this time._

Reference Storefront application for [Reaction Commerce](https://reactioncommerce.com/).

## Getting Started
_Follow steps as necessary. If you already have Reaction installed, you may be able to skip some of these steps._

0. Prerequesites
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Docker Compose is included when installing Docker on Mac and Windows, but will need to be installed separately on Linux.

1. Clone the main [Reaction repo](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) and checkout the `release-1.15.0` branch
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:reactioncommerce/reaction.git
    cd reaction
    git checkout release-1.15.0

    # change directory to the parent of your reaction install
    cd ..
    ```

2. Clone this repo
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:reactioncommerce/reaction-next-starterkit.git
    ```

3. Create a local docker network

    You'll need to create a docker network for the GraphQL service and the Reaction Storefront to communicate
    ```
    docker network create graphql.reaction.localhost
    ```
    You can run `docker network ls` to verify the network has been created.

4. Start Reaction's GraphQL server
    From your `reaction` directory run
    ```
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```
    You'll need to run the full app at least once in order for step 5 to work. After this initial run, if you don't want to start the Reaction Meteor app, you can just run `docker-compose up -d devserver`

5. Generate a Meteor login token

    _This process will be eliminated once we've built out the GraphQL API for authentication_
    - Visit the Reaction Meteor shop [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    - Open devtools and copy the Meteor.loginToken from `localStorage`.

6. Setup the Storefront environment

    Navigate to the `reaction-next-starterkit` directory and create a `.env` file.
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
7. Start the storefront application in development mode using Docker Compose
    ```
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

8. Visit the storefront on `localhost:4000`


## Development

### Build and run in development mode with logs
```
docker-compose up -d && docker-compose logs -f
```

### Running Commands inside the container
```
docker-compose run --rm web [command]
```
Run any command inside a Docker container and then remove the container. Use this to run any tooling operations. Remember your project directory will be mounted and things will usually just work.

### Running Tests in Container
Run tests locally
```sh
docker-compose run --rm web yarn test
````

Run tests locally without cache (this can be helpful if changes aren't showing up)
```sh
docker-compose run --rm web yarn test --no-cache
```

To update a failing snapshot (if you've made changes to a component)
```sh
docker-compose run --rm web yarn test -u
```

To run snyk security tests (this will run tests in the same way as CI)
```sh
docker-compose run --rm web sh -c "cp package.json ../ && cp .snyk ../ && cd .. && snyk auth && snyk test"
```

To run eslint
```sh
docker-compose run --rm web eslint src
```

### Yarn Commands

Yarn & NPM should run inside the Docker container. We've taken steps to ensure that the node_modules are placed into a cacheable location. If you run Yarn locally, the node_modules are written directly to the project directory and take precedence over those from the Docker build.
**Yarn Add**
```
docker-compose run --rm web yarn add --dev [package]
```

**Yarn Install**

⚠️ Always rebuild the image and start a new container after modifying yarn.lock or Dockerfile!
```
docker-compose run --rm web yarn install
docker-compose down --rmi local
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Testing `reaction-component-library` components in the starterkit

Sometimes we need to test [`reaction-component-library`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-component-library) components in the context of the starterkit. Unfortunetly, there isn't an easy wasy to do this within our Docker containers, so we need to run the `starterkit` outside of docker.

1. `cd` to your local [`reaction-component-library`](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-component-library) repo.
1. Git checkout the proper branch that you want to link
1. `cd` into the `package` folder of this repo, and run the command `yarn install` followed by `yarn build`
1. After the build is done, `cd` into the new `dist` folder it just built and run `yarn link` to allow the library to be installed into the starterkit. This will link `@reactioncommerce/components`
1. Inside the `reaction-next-starterkit` repo, temporarily rename your `.yarnrc` file to anything else (i.e. `.yarnrc-temp`)
1. Run `yarn install` and then the command `yarn link "@reactioncommerce/components"` to set the local version as an override of the published npm version
1. Inside your `.env` file, change `INTERNAL_GRAPHQL_URL` to equal `http://localhost:3030/graphql-alpha`, the same as the `EXTERNAL_GRAPHQL_URL`
1. Start the starterkit locally by running the command `export $(cat .env | xargs) && yarn dev`
1. Your starterkit should now be running at `localhost:4000`
    - If you see errors about not being able to find peer dependency packages, that seems to be an issues with yarn linking. You can just temporarily `yarn add` each of those packages in the component library `package/dist` folder. (This folder is gitignored anyway.)
1. After your changes are tested, shut down the starterkit by running the command `CTRL+C`
1. Run `yarn unlink "@reactioncommerce/components"` in the starterkit repo folder
1. `cd` to the `package/dist` folder of the `reaction-component-library` repo. Run the command `yarn unlink` to unlink the local version of the component library
1. Undo the renaming of your `.yarnrc` file
1. Undo the URL change inside your `.env` file

## Cleanup Containers
Stop, and retain containers:
```
docker-compose stop
```

Stop, and remove containers:
```
docker-compose down
```

Stop, and remove containers, volumes and built images:
```
docker-compose down -v --rmi local
```

## Production
Running the command below will build the starterkit for production.

```
docker build -t reaction-storefront --build-arg BUILD_ENV=production .
```

To start the app in production mode execute:

```
docker run -d --name storefront -p ${port}:4000 --env-file .env --network graphql reaction-storefront
```

To stop the docker container after starting it with the above command
```
docker stop storefront
```

_**NOTE:** Replace the `${port}` with the localhost port you'd like the application to run at. I'm partial to 4040_
_**NOTE:** The above command is assuming ether the `devserver` or `reaction` is also running._
