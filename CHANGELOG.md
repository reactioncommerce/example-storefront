# v2.0.0-rc.12
This is our fourth release candidate for this project. While this project is technically still `pre-release` until we've released the final 2.0.0 version, it's the most stable version of Reaction Commerce, and we recommend starting new projects with it at this point. See https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/issues/487#issuecomment-507468894 for more detail on this.

This version should be used with `v2.0.0-rc.12` of https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction

## Highlights
We have [renamed](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/example-storefront/pull/544) this project from `reaction-next-starterkit` to `example-storefront` to better convey the intent behind our creating it.  Weâ€™re also [updating our docs](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction-docs/pull/829) to clarify this change.

The GraphQL API in [reaction v2.0.0-rc.12](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/5259) has been changed from `/graphql-alpha` to `graphql-beta` to indicate the increased stability of the API. We think there are still some breaking changes to come in the next 3-6 months to the GraphQL API which is why we're keeping the `-beta` suffix for now. As you find bugs with that API, please file issues in the [reaction](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/issues) repo.

  (#504)

# Breaking Changes

### Multiple Payment Support

- All of the individual `placeOrder*` GraphQL mutations provided by the built-in payment plugins are removed and replaced with a single `placeOrder` mutation which supports multiple payments. Any custom payment method plugins will break due to the removal of `createOrder` internal mutation. Look at all changes. (https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction/pull/4908)
